# Getting oriented

- Let's load the gapminder dataset. 

```{r}
suppressMessages(library(dplyr)); suppressMessages(library(purrr)) # now go ahead and load them

data_gapminder <- read.csv(file.path("..", "..", "data", "gapminder_nas.csv"))

# let's also take a minute to install some libraries, in your console enter
#install.packages(c("dplyr", "purrr"))
```

:::notes
Let's go ahead and all load the gapminder dataset. For those of you both in person and on zoom go ahead and join the zoom to download the gapminder dataset. Please call the variable `data_gapminder_na` as I believe that will make following along easier and you'll get more out of it.

I would recommend working through this with me, sort of like a demo. Ideally, I think what you should do is open up an rscript file, and code along with the slides as I run through them. Pepper your code with comments as I'm making remarks, and hopefully this will help us get oriented with some basic data exploration in `Rstudio`!

# What are missing values

- Run `data_gapminder` in your console 

- `NA` stands for "not available", a special `boolean` for missing data within an object

- `NA_integer_`, `NA_real_`, `NA_complex_` and `NA_character_`

- `NULL` used for empty objects (points to the same singleton place in memory), think of it like an object purgatory. It exists and...it doesn't.

- Analogous (but perhaps not equivalent to) `SASS` `SYSMIS`

:::notes
The first thing you might notice if you run `data_gapminder` in the console is that there is a character which isn't a number or a character. It's a special value called `NA` or not availble. This is a special character that tells `R`--hey this value is missing!
:::

# How R handles 'missingness' 

```{r}
# you can test this yourself in R (if you don't believe me)
a <- NULL
b <- NA
c <- NA
# tracemem(a) # this will break 'Error in tracemem(a) : cannot trace NULL'
# two distinct places in memory, but they are 'missing' values
tracemem(b) 
tracemem(c)
is.null(a)
```

# Working with missing values

```{r}
na_values <- c("NA", "NULL", "", " ")
data_gapminder <- read.csv(file.path("..", "..", "data", "gapminder_nas.csv"), na.strings = na_values)
# is.na()
```

:::notes
So how do we handle this? Thankfully `R` makes this relatively easy and gives us a lot of options when dealing with missing data. The first way is dealing with it at the source sort of... The nice part about dealing with your missing values in place in your code is that this makes your workflow **highly** reproducible. Someone can follow the data you were handed (in whatever sorry state it was handed to you in) and reproduce the awesome analysis you did from step 1 to the end! This is reproducibility!! When importing or tyding your data, it's important to ensure that you're properly identifying missing values, and handling them with the arguments `na.strings`, if using `read.csv()`, or `na`, if using `read_csv()`.

# Complete cases


```{r}
complete_gapminder <- complete.cases(data_gapminder)
complete_gapminder <- data_gapminder[which(complete_gapminder),]
#typeof(complete_gapminder)
```


:::notes
The nuclear option here (not recommended honestly) is calling complete.cases. I personally would only ever use this if I had established in my analysis that NA values (for whatever reason) truly were not systematic in some way.
:::

# Small rant

```{r}
mean(data_gapminder[which(data_gapminder$continent == "Americas"),]$lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(complete_gapminder[which(complete_gapminder$continent == "Americas"),]$lifeExp)
```

:::notes
 on why you should (almost) never use complete.cases to clean your data like this: well deleting missing rows might systematically bias your data.
:::

# Imputation to the rescue?
```{r}
# Compare sample size before and after complete.cases
nrow(data_gapminder)
sum(complete.cases(data_gapminder))

# Simple example of mean imputation
data_imputed <- data_gapminder
data_imputed$lifeExp[is.na(data_imputed$lifeExp)] <- 
  mean(data_imputed$lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)
```


:::notes
Students (and my own former) first instinct with missing data is "AHHH" get it out of here, let's just delete it...right? WRONG! Above is a very simple example of something much better than throwing away missing data and that is imputation.
:::

# Inspecting data

```{r}
complete_gapminder <- complete.cases(data_gapminder) # for later use
# first few index numbers of complete cases
head(which(complete_gapminder))
```
:::notes
And for use later, when subsetting, we can also generate a vector of those which are complete, identified by  their index number. This is done with `which()`
:::

# Unique values

```{r}
unique(data_gapminder$continent)
```


# Duplicated values

```{r}
# on a vector
head(duplicated(data_gapminder$continent))

# there are 5 unique continents and 1699 duplicates
sum(duplicated(data_gapminder$continent))

# on a data frame
head(duplicated(data_gapminder))

# there are no duplicate values
sum(duplicated(data_gapminder))
```
:::notes
`duplicated()` returns a logical vector, `TRUE` for values (of a vector) or rows (of a data frame) that are duplicates, `FALSE` if they are unique. Since the first instance of a value is unique, the first value will return `FALSE`, and any subsequent duplicates will return `TRUE`.
:::

# Descriptive Statistics

:::notes 
Basic stats fucntions in R generally do not remove NA values by default, and if your data has NA values, they will return `NA`. You can avoid these errors with `na.rm = TRUE` as an argument.
:::

# Number of Observations

```{r}
length(data_gapminder$country)
length(data_gapminder) # will return ncol, but that's confusing
ncol(data_gapminder)
nrow(data_gapminder)
```
:::notes
When used on a data frame, however, `length()` returns the number of columns...
The number of values in a single vector can be derived with `length()`

When working with data frames, it is preferable to use `nrow()` and `ncol()` for the number of rows and columns, respectively.
:::

# The usual suspects: range, min, max, mean, median, sd, variance, quantiles

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
range(data_gapminder$year, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(data_gapminder$lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)
median(data_gapminder$gdpPercap, na.rm = TRUE)
min(data_gapminder$year, na.rm = TRUE)
max(data_gapminder$year, na.rm = TRUE)
quantile(data_gapminder$gdpPercap, na.rm = TRUE)
var(data_gapminder$lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(data_gapminder$lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)
```

:::notes
The range of your data can be calculated with `range()`. If you're only interested in the min or max values individually, this can be pulled with `min()` and `max()` respectively. The variance and SD are calculated with `var()` and `sd()`...
The mean and median are calculated with `mean()` and `median()` respectively...
Quantiles can be derived with `quantile()`, which defaults to the max, min and interquartiles.
:::

# Summaries

```{r}
# kable(summary(data_gapminder$gdpPercap)) # could also summarise just one column
summary(data_gapminder)
```
:::notes
Much of the above can be gathered all at once if needed with `summary()`. `summary()` can be run on a single vector, or on an entire data frame...
:::

# Proper summary

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data_gapminder[1:2] <- lapply(data_gapminder[1:2], as.factor)
summary(data_gapminder)
```

:::notes
A better summary would come from properly denoted data types...
:::

# Exploring data in `DPLYR`: A better way to do data

```{r echo = FALSE}
data_gapminder %>%
  summarise(
    mean_life = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_life   = sd(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_life  = min(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_life  = max(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% flextable() %>% flextable::theme_vanilla() %>%
  flextable::autofit() %>%                # adjusts columns to content
  flextable::set_table_properties(        # ensures full-width fit
    width = 1,
    layout = "autofit"
  )
```

# Code for prior slide's table


```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data_gapminder %>%
  summarise(
    mean_life = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_life   = sd(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_life  = min(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_life  = max(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% flextable() %>% flextable::theme_vanilla() %>%
  flextable::autofit() %>%                # adjusts columns to content
  flextable::set_table_properties(        # ensures full-width fit
    width = 1,
    layout = "autofit"
  )
```

:::notes
Emphasize readability — column names and calculations are right next to each other. Introduce the %>% pipe if not done before (“then do this”).
:::

# Exploring data in `DPLYR`: groups

```{r}
data_gapminder %>%
  # `group_by` this automatically groups things by class for you very powerful
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_life = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )
```

:::notes
`dplyr`s `group_by` is simple powerful syntax to quickly ascertain relationships by groups. 
:::

# Exploring data `PURRRfectly`: functional programming

```{r}
data_gapminder %>%
  split(.$continent) %>%
  map(~ mean(.x$lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE))
```
:::notes
While admittedly less clear than dplyr syntax. purrr is a “repeat yourself less” toolkit. Here, instead of writing a loop, we map the same function over a list of continent datasets.
:::

# Visualizing Distributions

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
hist(data_gapminder$gdpPercap)
```


# Histograms

```{r}
hist(data_gapminder$gdpPercap)
```
:::notes
You can plot a basic histogram with `hist()`
Plotting for presentation will be covered in greater detail in a future session.
Basic plotting for distribution analysis is relatively straight forward in base R.
:::

# Histograms cont'd

```{r}
hist(data_gapminder$gdpPercap, breaks = 30)
```
:::notes
And you can increase the 'buckets' with the `breaks` argument
:::

# Density Plots

```{r}
dens <- density(data_gapminder$lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(dens)
```
:::notes
A density plot can be generated with `plot()`, but requires the extra step of computing the density of the data with the `density()` function first
:::
# Distribution of Two Variables

```{r echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE}
boxplot(data_gapminder$lifeExp ~ data_gapminder$continent)
```

# Box Plots

```{r}
boxplot(data_gapminder$lifeExp ~ data_gapminder$continent)
```
:::notes
`boxplot()` allows you to facet one variable by another using a tilde `~` to define the relationship
:::

# Scatter Plots

```{r}
plot(x = data_gapminder$gdpPercap, y = data_gapminder$lifeExp)
```

:::notes
`plot()` by default assumes a single variable as in the earlier example, but will generate a scatter plot if provided with two variables, the first assigned to the x-axis, the second to the y-axis.
:::

# Data transformations for better visualisation

```{r}
# log transform gdp per capita
plot(x = log(data_gapminder$gdpPercap), y = data_gapminder$lifeExp)
```

:::notes
You can also transform you data within the function for quick investigation
