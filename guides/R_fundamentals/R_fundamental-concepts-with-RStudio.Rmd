R is great for interactive computational analysis, allowing for easy exploration and iteration. Using an IDE - Integrated Development Environment - such as RStudio, facilitates this interactivity, providing you with easy access to a place to quickly code (the console), a place to write saveable scripts (source editor), a place to view the objects that you create (environment pane), and a place to interact with your file system, visual outputs from your code, and help documentation (the miscellaneous pane, for lack of a better word).

Base R (as it's affectionately called) is great, but the cool thing about R is it's huge ecosystem of packages which are constantly being expanded both on the central repository for the R programming language Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and outside of CRAN. As of the writing of this RMD there are over 22,000 packages on CRAN.

# Simple Math

3 - 2 # subtract

At it's most basic, R is a glorified calculator, capable of any operation might wish to throw at it...

# Functions

```{r}
# c() is a common function for concatenating things together
c(1:10)
```
:::notes
At least initially, everything you do in R will be applying functions to data. In the above section, the mathematical operators, `sqrt()`, and `log10()`, are all functions. Functions take in data (or values) and process them, providing an output. The output is displayed in your console by default.

# Variables

```{r echo = FALSE}

```

# Variables Cont'd

```{r}
# You can then recall the values (object) associated with your variable...
my_variable <- c(1:10)
myAlphabet <- letters[1:5]
myNumbers <- c(1:5)
#And plug it into functions, ie, do computations on it...

my_variable

my_variable * 2
```
:::notes
While having outputs directed to the console is convenient for interactive analysis, often we need to store data and / or outputs for later use. We do this with variable assignment, where the greater than and dash are used to assign the values (object) on the right to the name (variable) on the left.
When naming variables in R, keep in mind that variable names:
:::

---

# Naming variables

```{r}
# camel case
myNumber <- "Hello" # bad naming
myNumber <- 10 # good naming
# skeleton case
my_number <- 10
```


:::notes
Should first and foremost be meaningful. This is not a rule, just best practice. Cannot start with a number or a dot followed by a number. Cannot contain spaces or hyphens. Can contain letters, numbers, dots, and underscores.

Additionally, some words are reserved and cannot be used, such as if and for. More details can be found with `?make.names`

# Data Types


* Note: The function `typeof()`, will tell you what data type you have...

:::notes
Data types are elemental data constructs that R is able to distinguish between. The most common data types in R are numeric, character, and boolean. These come with intrinsic properties, for example, numeric data can be computed (added, divided, etc), character data can be strung together (character data, especially groups of characters are referred to as strings), and boolean data facilitates working with dichotomous values.
:::

---

# Boolean (Logical Data)

* `boolean` data are generally referred to as `logical`

```{r}
myBool <- TRUE # this is camel case
typeof(myBool)
```

---

# Numeric (Double)

* `numeric` data are subdivided into `double` and `integer`; the difference is generally of little significance, as R manages the distinctions for you, but be wary if you're dealing with particularly large numbers

```{r}
myDouble <- 10.5
typeof(myDouble)
```


---

# Numeric (Integer)

```{r}
myInteger <- 10L
typeof(myInteger)
```


---

# Characters

* `character` data always needs to be wrapped in single or double quotations.

```{r}
myChar <- "a" # Note that R does not distinguish between '' and "" but the use has to match
typeof(myChar)

```
---

# Complex

```{r}
myComplexNum <- 9 + 3i
typeof(myComplexNum)
```

---

# Data Structures

Data structures are ways to hold multiple pieces of data together in a meaningful way. R has four convenient ways of storing multiple pieces of data: vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists.

---

# Vectors

:::notes
The most basic is a `vector`. In fact, everything in R is a vector, and all other data structures are composed of vectors in various ways. It's convenient to think of a vector as a simple list of like things; everything in a vector needs to be of the same data type. So, a vector can be:

* numeric, holding numeric data;
* character, holding character data; or
* logical, holding boolean data.

A vector can be created with `c()`
:::
```{r}
# numeric vector
c(1:10)

# character vector
c("a", "b", "c")

# logical vector
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

# note that vectors do not allow you to mix types
# c(TRUE, 10) # this will convert TRUE to 1
# c(TRUE, "10") # this will convert TRUE to "TRUE"
```

---

# Matrices

```{r}
matrix(1:10, nrow = 2)
```

:::notes
A matrix is a vector with 2 dimensions; while a vector only has a length, a matrix is a grid with both length and width, or alternatively, rows and columns.

You can create a matrix with the `matrix()` function, providing it first with a series of values followed by an argument for the number of rows or columns you'd like. A matrix must be perfectly rectangular, that is, each column must be of equal length. R will recycle values to ensure this condition is met. A matrix must also be atomic - the data type must be the same throughout.
:::

---

# Data frames

```{r}
data.frame(letter = letters[1:5],
           nol = 1:5) # nol mean number of letter
```

:::notes
In general, these will be the most likely data structures that you'll encounter and the most familiar, as they are designed for tabular data and look like a spreadsheet.

Data frames are collections of vectors, where each vector must be of the same length, but can be of a different data type. If you import data from an Excel or csv file, these will be read in as a data frame. You can also create them with the `data.frame()` function.
:::

---

# Lists


```{r}
list(item_1 = myAlphabet,
     item_2 = c(1:3))
```

:::notes
Like data frames, lists are collections of vectors. However, unlike data frames, the length of these vectors can change. So far, this is the only non-rectangular data structure that we have to work with.

If you are importing tabular data, you are unlikely to create a list yourself, however, when performing operations (using functions) on your data, the output, or result, might be in the form of a list. For demonstration puropses, a list can be created with the `list()` function.

# Arrays

```{r}
array(c(1, 2, 3, 4), dim = c(1, 2, 2))
```
:::notes
Arrays are an n-dimensional generalization of the 
:::


---

# Identifying Data Structures


```{r}
class(c(1:10))
class(matrix(1:10, ncol = 2))
class(data.frame(var_1 = letters,var_2 = 1:26))
class(list(item_1 = letters,item_2 = 1:10,item_3 = c(TRUE, FALSE)))
```

:::notes
The function `class()` will tell you what kind of structure your data are held in. `class()`, when called on a vector, will report on the data type, which should be read as the type of atomic vector you have. An array is a multi-dimensional vector, a matrix is the special case where there are only two dimensions.

# Getting Help

* The `learnr` package is a resource for learning how to navigate R!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sqrt()
```

:::notes
These pages can be both enlightening and frustrating, as they assume some pre-existing familiarity with certain concepts as well as reading this kind of documentation.

The second is from forums. These are useful when you have a specific issue that you're trying to resolve, and can often provide a quick fix, but the explanations also often require a degree of familiarity to make sense.

The third is blog posts and course supports posted on line. These generally provide more context than forum posts, and are useful when tyring to learn a new approach or a new library.

The fourth is journal publications that accompany the release of specific packages or libraries. These offer in depth descriptions of the packages and their arguments, often with examples.

The fourth is more in depth texts. Many of these are available publicly online, and include titles such as:
