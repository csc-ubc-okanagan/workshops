## Workshop Model

All workshops are series based, with material building on itself throughout the term, as well as between series. Individual workshop are scheduled for roughly 1 hour, with 30 minutes of instructor led content, 15 minutes for Q&A related to the content, and 15 minutes for follow up if needed.

Workshop content is available online for simultaneous or asynchronous engagement, as well as being supported by our [blog](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/R-Python-Blog/), and [research data consultations](https://csc.ok.ubc.ca/consultations/research-data-consultation/).
